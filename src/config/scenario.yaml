# NOTE: All environments must use the same grid size (MERLIN_C2 requirement).
# Using 8x8 ensures consistent observation/action spaces for PPO & future Meta-RL.

difficulties:
  easy:
    env_id: MiniGrid-Empty-8x8-v0
    params:
      render_mode: rgb_array
      max_steps: 100
      # NOTE: Easy tasks should be solvable with minimal exploration.

  medium:
    env_id: MiniGrid-DoorKey-8x8-v0
    params:
      render_mode: rgb_array
      max_steps: 250
      # NOTE: Medium tasks introduce reasoning (key-door), but keep the same grid size.

  hard:
    env_id: MiniGrid-Dynamic-Obstacles-8x8-v0
    params:
      render_mode: rgb_array
      max_steps: 300
      # NOTE: Hard tasks must remain the same grid size.
      # Dynamic obstacles add stochasticity → good for testing generalization.
